Overview
This Colab notebook is designed to transcribe audio files using three popular speech-to-text (STT) systems: OpenAI's Whisper, Google Speech-to-Text (Google STT), and NVIDIA NeMo. After generating transcriptions, the notebook compares these to existing ground truth transcriptions to compute Word Error Rate (WER), Character Error Rate (CER), and P-Test statistics. These metrics help evaluate the accuracy and reliability of each transcription model.

Key Features
Audio Transcription:
Utilizes Whisper, Google STT, and NeMo models to transcribe audio files.
Error Rate Calculation:
Computes Word Error Rate (WER) to assess the accuracy of transcriptions at the word level.
Computes Character Error Rate (CER) to assess the accuracy of transcriptions at the character level.
Performs a P-Test to statistically compare the performance of the models.
Comparison with Ground Truth:
Compares the generated transcriptions with provided ground truth transcriptions to evaluate model performance.
Requirements
Google Colab: This notebook is designed to run in Google Colab for easy access to resources and GPU support.
Python Libraries: The following Python libraries are required:
openai-whisper: For transcriptions using Whisper.
google-cloud-speech: For transcriptions using Google STT.
nemo: For transcriptions using NeMo.
jiwer: For calculating WER.
Levenshtein: For calculating CER.
scipy: For performing the P-Test.
Google Cloud Account: A Google Cloud account is required with access to the Google Speech-to-Text API.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

Clone the Colab notebook or download it directly to your Google Drive.
Install Dependencies:

Install the required Python libraries using pip.

Set Up Google Cloud Credentials:

Set up your Google Cloud credentials by following the Google Cloud SDK instructions and uploading the json key file to your Colab environment.

Load Audio Files:

Upload the audio files you want to transcribe and the corresponding ground truth transcriptions to the Colab environment.
Run the Notebook:

Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to transcribe the audio files using Whisper, Google STT, and NeMo, and then compare the results with the ground truth transcriptions.
Usage
Transcription:

The notebook provides functions to load audio files and generate transcriptions using the three STT models.

Comparison and Evaluation:

Compare the generated transcriptions with the ground truth and compute WER, CER, and P-Test statistics.

Visualization:

Visualize the results to easily compare the performance of each model.
Output
The notebook will output the transcriptions generated by each model, along with the WER, CER, and P-Test results for each transcription when compared to the ground truth.
